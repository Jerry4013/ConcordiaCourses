  Figure 5.4 shows a browser display of radio_click.html. Figure 5.5
  shows the alert window that results from choosing the Model 182 radio button
  in radio_click.html.
  In radio_click.html, the event handler is registered by assigning its
  call to the onclick attribute of the radio buttons. The specific button that was
  clicked is identified by the parameter sent in the handler call in the button element.
  An alternative to using the parameter would be to include code in the
  handler to determine which radio button was pressed.
  The next example, radio_click2.html, whose purpose is the same as that
  of radio_click.html, registers the event handler by assigning the name of
  the handler to the event properties of the radio button objects. For example, the
  following line of code registers the handler on the first radio button:
