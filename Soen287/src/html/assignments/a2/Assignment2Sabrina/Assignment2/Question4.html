    <!--
.Write a function Patternmatch in JS language declared in the document head section.
.This function takes a parameter an array of strings called names.
.This function returns the number of names in the given array that end in either
."ly" or "ne" patterns and they have also at least one 'a' in their names.

/[a](ly)$/ or /[a](ne)$/

The test driver of the program must be defined as a script in the body section,
.including the declaration of the array and the invocation of the function.
.Use this following data of the array (names):

.Names = "bradly", "anna", "john", "sherly", "adriane"

.The array must be created as an instance of the class Array using the "new" operator.

The program displays the result as follows: (the table on top has a dotted border style,
the text and background have different colours
and their colours are different from the border colour.
Use a separate css file for the style.
