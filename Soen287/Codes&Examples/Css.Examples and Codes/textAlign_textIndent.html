		<h1>Basic Facts About Elephants</h1>
		<h2>Diet</h2>
		<p>Staples: Grasses, leaves, bamboo, bark, roots. Elephants are also known to eat crops like banana
		and sugarcane which are grown by farmers. Adult elephants eat 300-400 lbs of food per day.</p>
		
		<h2 class="right">Population</h2>
		<p class="one">At the turn of the 20th century, there were a few million African elephants and about
		100,000 Asian elephants. Today, there are an estimated 450,000 - 700,000 African elephants and between 
		35,000 - 40,000 wild Asian elephants.</p>
		
		<h2>Range</h2>
		<p class="two">African savannah elephants are found in savannah zones in 37 countries south of the Sahara
		Desert. African forest elephants inhabit the dense rainforests of west and central Africa. The Asian elephant
		is found in India, Sri Lanka, China and much of Southeast Asia.</p>
		
		<h2 class="center">Behavior</h2>
		<p class="three">Elephants form deep family bonds and live in tight matriarchal family groups of related females
		called a herd. The herd is led by the oldest and often largest female in the herd, called a matriarch. Herds
		consist of 8-100 individuals depending on terrain and family size. When a calf is born, it is raised and
		protected by the whole matriarchal herd. Males leave the family unit between the ages of 12-15 and may lead
		solitary lives or live temporarily with other males.</p>
