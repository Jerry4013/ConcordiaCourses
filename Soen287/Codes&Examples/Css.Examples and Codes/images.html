	<h1>Basic Facts About Elephants</h1>
	
	<h3>Diet</h3>
	<p>Staples: Grasses, leaves, bamboo, bark, roots. Elephants are also known to eat crops like banana and sugarcane
	which are grown by farmers. Adult elephants eat 300-400 lbs of food per day.</p>
	<h3>Population</h3>
	<p>At the turn of the 20th century, there were a few million African elephants and about 100,000 Asian elephants.
	Today, there are an estimated 450,000 - 700,000 African elephants and between 35,000 - 40,000 wild Asian elephants.</p>

	<h3>Range</h3>
	<p>African savannah elephants are found in savannah zones in 37 countries south of the Sahara Desert. African
	forest elephants inhabit the dense rainforests of west and central Africa. The Asian elephant is found in India, 
	Sri Lanka, China and much of Southeast Asia.</p>
	<h3>Behavior</h3>
	<p>Elephants form deep family bonds and live in tight matriarchal family groups of related females called a herd.
	The herd is led by the oldest and often largest female in the herd, called a matriarch. Herds consist of 8-100
	individuals depending on terrain and family size. When a calf is born, it is raised and protected by the whole
	matriarchal herd. Males leave the family unit between the ages of 12-15 and may lead solitary lives or live
	temporarily with other males.</p>
	<p>Elephants are extremely intelligent animals and have memories that span many years. It is this memory that
	serves matriarchs well during dry seasons when they need to guide their herds, sometimes for tens of miles, 
	to watering holes that they remember from the past. They also display signs of grief, joy, anger and play.</p>
	<p>Recent discoveries have shown that elephants can communicate over long distances by producing a sub-sonic 
	rumble that can travel over the ground faster than sound through air. Other elephants receive the messages 
	through the sensitive skin on their feet and trunks. It is believed that this is how potential mates and social 
	groups communicate.</p>
	<h3>Reproduction</h3>
	<p>Mating Season: Mostly during the rainy season.<br />
	Gestation: 22 months.<br />
	Litter size: 1 calf (twins rare).<br />
	Calves weigh between 200-250 lbs at birth. At birth, a calf's trunk has no muscle tone, therefore it will 
	suckle through its mouth. It takes several months for a calf to gain full control of its trunk.
