      I was born on July 4th, 
      1976, in Huckabee, Alaska.
      I have three brothers and
      a sister, all older than I.
      My sister, Mary, is 26 years old.
      She lives in Kalkan, Montana.
      My oldest brother, Ron, is 32
      years old. He lives in Huckabee.
      My youngest brother, Max, is 
      28 years old. He lives in Pinkee,
      Wyoming. My middle brother, Fred,
      is 30 years old. He lives in
      Kinkyhollow, Nebraska.
      My parents, who are both still
