		<h1> My favorite coffee </h1>
		<h2> at Starbuck </h2>
		<p>We pour our hot espresso over a slightly sweet mocha sauce and let 
		them melt into a wonderfully rich concoction. Then we add steamed
		milk to the mix to balance the richness out into a chocolaty treat
		that delights the senses without overdoing it. Add some whipped
		cream to the top, but only if you want that little extra kick of sweetness.</p>
