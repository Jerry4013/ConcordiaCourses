## Project 1 -- Group 5

All the SQL code is in the file *project1.sql*.

The SQL script was executed in our database *erc353_2*. The data can be found there.

The *project1.php* is a simple web page displaying the data fetched from the database.

The three png files are the screenshots after executing "SELECT * FROM" SQL statement.

The web page URL is: [https://erc353.encs.concordia.ca/project1.php](https://erc353.encs.concordia.ca/project1.php)

We use bootstrap, so the two bootstrap css and js files are necessary to display the page.
